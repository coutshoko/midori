# **Escape from Tarkov Price Filter**

This project is a **price prediction tool** for **Escape from Tarkov’s** flea market system, where prices for in-game items fluctuate in real time. By utilizing data fetched from the **Tarkov.dev API**, the tool calculates and filters items based on their **price drop percentage** over the last 48 hours. If an item’s price has decreased by more than 50%, there’s a significant chance that the price will rebound, offering a potential profit opportunity, much like in a **stock market**.
